               <h3>Soul</h3>
    <p>Joe Gardner, a middle-school band teacher, gets the chance of a lifetime to play at the best jazz club in town. But, one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before – a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22, who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 whatʼs great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions.</p>
